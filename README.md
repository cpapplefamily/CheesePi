# Python code to run on a Raspberry Pi to interface with Cheesy Arena

# This is a work in proccess. Spelling errors and reliability issues still need to be addressed. 

## Warnings
currently this only works with a modified version of Cheesy Arena that Excepts different Keystrokes that are filtered by Cheesy Arena dependent of the MatchStatus. I will be soon fixing this now that Cheese Pi is recieving Match Status Data

This must be run using sudo and retaining user enviorment using the -E switch
Currently run using sudo -E Python3 cheesePi.py

I still need to compile a list of libraies that will need to be installed to use. The system 
This was developed on had many interations of projects built. After I install it on a fresh 
image I can try to inclued what needs to be installed.
