# Python code to run on a Raspberry Pi to interface with Cheesy Arena

## Warnings
currently this only works with a modified version of Cheesy Arena that Excepts different Keystrokes that are filtered by Cheesy Arena dependent of the MatchStatus. I will be soon fixing this now that Cheese Pi is recieving Match Status Data
